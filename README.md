**FreeCAD** is a Free (as in Libre) multiplatform Open Source Parametric 3D CAM software.   
**Homebrew** is a MacOSX Package Manager.
## Overview
The primary and frequent use case for this formula is for developers to conveniently install all the required FreeCAD dependencies to support FreeCAD development.  
#### NOTE: If you are looking for the current macOS builds, please download the latest build from [GitHub](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases)

## Prerequisites
Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh)

## Installing FreeCAD dependencies (FreeCAD developers)
Developers may find it convenient to simply install the pre-requisites prior to cloning the FreeCAD repo for development builds.

    brew tap FreeCAD/freecad
    brew install --only-dependencies freecad [--with-qt4] [--with-packaging-utils]

#### Install flags
`--with-qt4 option` use this option to install Qt4 and associated dependencies (defaults to Qt 5.x)  
`--with-packaging-utils` use this option to install the packaging utilities

## Building The Current Release Version of FreeCAD

    brew tap FreeCAD/freecad
    brew install freecad

## Building HEAD Version of FreeCAD

    brew install --HEAD freecad

## Continuous Integration Support
The Travis CI system uses this freecad formula to build and test FreeCAD every time
a change is made to the FreeCAD/FreeCAD repo meaning that the formula is very well
tested itself.
